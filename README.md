Disinformation homework assigment


**Q2**. *(Extra credit, 3 points)* Re-download the 1000 TimeMaps from HW2, Q2.  Create a graph where the x-axis represents the 1000 TimeMaps.  If a TimeMap has "shrunk", it will have a negative value below the x-axis corresponding to the size difference between the two TimeMaps.  If it has stayed the same, it will have a "0" value.  If it has grown, the value will be positive and correspond to the increase in size between the two TimeMaps.

As always, upload all the TimeMap data.  If the HW2 github has the original TimeMaps, then you can just point to where they are in 
the report.
